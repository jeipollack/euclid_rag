# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Some guidelines to help you contribute effectively:

## Communication Style

1. Include screenshots for visual changes.
2. Provide a detailed description in your Pull Request—leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewer.
3. Review your code first. Comment on complex or noteworthy code for the reviewer.
4. Maintain clear communication. Whether in an issue or a pull request, keep discussions open and informative.

## Installing and testing

See [README](../README.md).

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. Linking to an existing issue is preferred.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` or the designated default branch.
2. Use descriptive branch names like `feature/add-new-thing`.
3. Add tests for new code where applicable.
4. Update documentation for API changes.
5. Include screenshots for visual changes.
6. Ensure the test suite passes.
7. Resolve any lint warnings.
8. Indicate improvements to existing code in your PR description.
9. PR titles should begin with "feat:" or "fix:".
10. Link your work to an [existing issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls). PRs without a linked issue will be closed.

*Note: All pull requests need a label for automation. Follow [this template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for guidance.*
